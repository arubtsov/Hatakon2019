 SessionMixingException occurs in some scenarios if a non persistent object is the BaseObject descendant,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
 I&#39;m getting a SessionMixingException when I update persistent objects, from a listview action that opens up a nonpersistent detail view.<br />
This worked fine in previous DX versions but not in 13.2.7.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve attached an example that demonstrates the issue. On the &#39;Data Row Item&#39; List view there is an action button &#39;Allocate Data&#39;. This pops up a nonpersistent detail view of type DataItemAllocationCriteria.  <br />
<br />
The user picks all sorts of options (limited in this example) that are applied to select dataRowItems to allocate to a person.<br />
<br />
The action then assigns the selected number of DataRowItems to the personnel, if I call ObjectSpace.Refresh() in order to refresh the root list view, now I get this exception on my nonpersistent object: <br />
<br />
<i>Type:       SessionMixingException<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message:    The &#39;SessionMixingExample.Module.BusinessObjects.DataItemAllocationCriteria&#39; object belongs to a different session.<br />

Add the capability for end-users to write scripts in the Designer for event handlers,"<p>Hi ALL,<br />
 <br />
   First of all congrats for new stuff in 13.2x. We are facing the need of put custom code depending of events triggered by user actions during the dasboard manipulation. That is very similar to existing feature in Report Designer (I guess VBA or something similiar). I ´ve seen the launch of some events related to masterfilter in 13.2, but the major point here is the ability to put custom code without VS deployment, only by Dashboard Designer.<br />

Animation flash effect when added at runtime,"<p>Hi.<br />
I attach my sample project.<br />
 I have to add tile control and animated tile items run time.<br />
In the example you can see that going from colored frame to frame with the back image, the animation is not completely fluid: there is a short preview (like a rapid flash...) of the backgroud image, and then start the animation correctly. Instead from frame with the back image to the colored one, all seems to be normal.<br />
Why? Can you help me? <br />
Thank a lot<br />

Appearance of XtraUserControl - How to change a border color,"Hello,<br /> i want to use the XtraUsercontrol as a container control for several XtraEditors.<br />I selected XtraUsercontrol instead of the normal winforms Usercontrol due to its appearance properties.<br />Now&nbsp; i try to set the border style and border color of the XtraUsercontrol and so i set the lookandfeel style property to flat and set the corresponding appearance properties. But the border of the user control doesn't show the set border color.<br /><br />Also if i set the lookandfeel style back to skin and set Autoscroll = true the srollbars of the XtraUsercontrol are not skinned. <br />Scrollbars are shown in the normal windows theme.<br /><br />Is there something i have to consider. If the&nbsp;appearance settings are not supported, what is the difference to the normal Usercontrol?<br /><br />Regards<br />Olaf<br />"
Application cannot connect to the Internet,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I am having a deployment specific issue where if my user is already using their internet (e.g. recently refreshed a web browser or any other app on their device) then my app is working fine (which connects to a data service) but if user&#39;s internet connection (mostly 3G,4G) is in ideal state, my app does not attempt to connect to internet and a loading icon is shown.<br />

Asian characters are not displayed correctly on exporting data to PDF,"<p>When using the Dashboard Viewer to export to PDF , Japanese characters are not displaying properly in the output.  So far we have not had any issues with characters not displaying properly in the designer or viewer so it only appears to be a PDF export issue.(the export to image works fine)  I have verified that the same problem occurs in the designer and both the web viewer and win viewer.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling it is strictly a font/font encoding issue, so if there was a way to set the font and font encoding used by the pdf exporter in code then I could properly work around the issue.  I tried changing the font properties of the viewer component to use a standard japanese font and to use the Japanese character set, however this did not seem to affect the font used by the PDF exporter.<br />
<br />
At this stage in the evaluation process we are very satisfied with the features provided by your product and this is the first major problem we have had , as such it would please me greatly if we could find a way to solve the export issue.<br />
<br />
I have provided a sample PDF to illustrate the problem.  You can recognize the characters not being exported correctly as they appear as squares.</p>"

I also have a button which initiates a callback of a ASPxCallbackPanel, which, on it's part, tries to send data to the server - the values of the selected items of the comboboxes. <br><br>My second combobox is obviously filled during its own callback, JavaScript reacting to selected index changed, alerting with the selected value on the screen.

ASPxFormLayout -  How to make the editors fill the entire area,"Dear DevExpress Support,<br><br>I am currently evaluating a trial version of DevExpress 18.x for the creation of a new ASP.NET based application.<br>I am rather new to Webdevelopment and am not so familiar with all these concepts in contrast to the Windows Forms application development. .<br><br>I now try to create a multi tabbed layout that contains 3 ASPxFormLayout controls that hold my controls that I want to populate.<br><br>I've laid out the layouot like I want it to be in the designer (see Attachment 1).<br><br>However when the application runs, the controls are much to short and look rather ugly.<br>I want them to span the available space within the defined ColSpan . See Attachment 2.<br><br>I searched for a property which would allow me to to do this and stumpled over GridSettings.StretchLastItem, which neatly strechted the controls like I want them to. However, my layout is not honored anymore now, and I only have one control per line... .<br><br>How can I achieve my goal?

ASPxFormLayout - The client-side FindItemByName method doesn't work when the control is in ASPxCallbackPanel,I'm using the formlayout.FindItemByName clientside method and found that when the formlayout is contained within an aspxcallbackpanel it doesn't work.&nbsp; It&nbsp;returns the&nbsp;formlayout object but not the item. The method works fine for formlayouts which aren't in a callbackpanel.&nbsp; I've checked the client IDs and they are all set and referenced correctly.<br><br>Why would this be? Is there a different way of referencing the formlayout in callbackpanels?<br><br>Many Thanks<br><br>Marcus<br> 
ASPxGlobalEvents - The sender argument of the BeginCallback event refers to the ASPxGlobalEvents component instance rather than to the control that initiates a callback,In v2015 vol 1.x the sender of public events is control which raise event.<br>In v2015 vol 2.x &nbsp;the sender of public events is always&nbsp;ASPxGlobalEvents control.<br>Confirm this breaking change?

"ASPxGridView - HeaderFilter doesn't filter blank items if HeaderFilterMode is ""CheckedList""","<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I am using an aspxgridview with a header filter using checkboxes.<br />

when trying the filtering on this column using checkboxes, we can see and select the empty string, but it is not applied in the filter and automatically gets unchecked again. <br />
This gives very strange behaviour because when the end user clicks &#39;(select all)&#39; it does in fact not contain the empty string values!<br />

ASPxGridView - How to determine when the grid's callback is handled on the server side,"<p>Hi ,<br />
I am facing the following problem :<br />
<br />
I have two instances of the same custom web user control .This control contains an aspxgridview control.So my page when loads contains two grids.<br />
Each grid loads some kind of events.So the first loads current events and the second upcoming events.<br />
Each grid is a master detail grid and when user clicks to  a master record is able to see all details records.<br />
<br />
I want to do the following when user expands a master record of the first grid  then the server understands that callback comes from first grid so doesn&#39;t load data of the second grid.I tried to use BeginCallback to pass as value to a hidden field the clientInstanceName of first grid but this property is not available at clientside.<br />
I am trying to do this because i can pass clientinstancename to each grid at server side during initialization and distinguish them on demand.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to solve this ?<br />

I tried also the ASPxGlobalEvents but i noticed the same behaviour<br />

But when page size is selected as &quot;All &quot; then the item count only shows the number of visible rows in the grid, i.e. if a group header is collapsed it counts it as one row no matter how many row are under that group.<br />

ASPxGridView - Slow web page performance with large database,"Hi,<br /><br />I have a web page with several devexpress controls (chart and gridviews) that are connected to database via SqlDataSource, the database has a 2M rows and growing quite fast. The controls need agregated fields (groupby) and since there are 6 in the page it takes some time to render.<br />In order to reduce this time I have create a data class that make just one connection to de database and fill all the controls, this class is keeped in a session variable to minimize database connections.<br /><br />QUESTION:<br />I wonder if devexpress has already solved this problem: that is if there is a way to just make one call to the database obtain an snapshot of the data (ie. filter by two dates) so that snapshot can be consumed by differente controls (ie. one control will need to make a groupby over a certain field and other will need to filter the data by other field)?, can it also make this data persistent in the page so only when the filter dates changes it will be needed to call de data base again?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Jaime"

ASPxGridView loses the bottom border in Moderno theme when its last row is in edit mode,"<p>I am having an issue that I can&#39;t figure out.  I have a gridview inside of a roundpanel.  When the rows in the gridview are in a normal state, everything looks fine.  When the last row of the gridview goes in to edit mode, it loses the bottom border of the row.  This seems to only happen when the Moderno theme is applied to the grid.  It also only happens on the last row, and it happens whether or not the gridview is inside the roundpanel.  Editing any other row maintains the expected look of the grid.  I have attached a screenshot showing the issue. Edit mode on top, normal mode on the bottom</p>"

ASPxGridView width is too narrow if the control is initially located on an inactive ASPxPageControl tab,"<p>I&#39;m using an AspxGridView that needs to have both horizontal and vertical scrollbars. This grid is contained in an UpdatePanel. The data source of the grid is set at Page_PreRender, but it still doesn&#39;t work even if it is set at Page_Load. The number of rows depends on the value of the textbox underneath the grid. This textbox causes a partial postback. Note that any partial postback generates the issue, even switching tabs.<br />
How to reproduce the issue: Click inside the textbox and press Enter. The grid will disappear and turn grey. After analyzing with Firebug I noticed that the width of the rows is not calculated.</p><p>I attached a sample project (one of DevExpress&#39; demo projects modified).

ASPxPopupControl size grows in Visual Studio Deisgner if the internal ASPxButton's Text property contains a string with spaces,"<p>Hello DevExpress,</p>Since few updates, an annoying bug appears on Visual Studio Design when an aspxButton is in an aspxpopupControl. <br />

For each spaces in the aspxbutton&#39;s text, it adds a new line at the end of the PopupControl. Here a screenshot : <br />

The final rendering is correct in the browser. Like I said, It&#39;s only in VS design <br />

Temporary solution :<br />
Replacing space by &quot;&amp;nbsp&quot; or changing the wrap option of the button to True or False instead of Default can resolve this or ignoring it .. <br />

ASPxRibbon and ASPxGridView controls placed together in the 'table' element aren't resized after browser resizing,"<p>Hello, <br />
<br />
I am having a weird problem with the 100% width on both the AspxRibbonBar and AspxGridView. I have attached a sample project showing the problem. <br />
<br />
Open the project <br />
Resize the your browser <br />
When you are making the browser bigger the controls will resize correctly. However, when you make the browser smaller the controls do not go smaller. <br />
<br />
If you remove the AspxRibbonbar or if you remove the AspxGridview the other control will resize correctly.<br />
<br />
This is a major issue because this project is released and customers are not able to see the full grid if they resize the browser window. <br />
<br />
Please let me know what I can do to fix this!<br />
<br />
Thank you!</p>"

I&#39;ve been able to replicate this problem on multiple browsers.<br />
<br />
Attached is a sample project to replicate the problem, it doesn&#39;t appear to happen every time but switching between the tabs eventually one will add a min-height style that is too large. In my testing it seems to happen with &quot;Testing Tab 10&quot; most of the time. To replicate it you may need to select tab 10 then select another tab then select tab 10 again.<br />
<br />
Also attached are 3 images:<br />
correct.png contains the image of what it should look like including the styles added.<br />
incorrect.png contains the image of what it shouldn&#39;t be doing and shows the min-height style that is set to the tab control.<br />
html.png shows the html output from the tab control.<br />

ASPxTextBox - ASPxEditors in UpdatePanel - When I press 'Enter' I execute the button (postback),"<p>Hello,<br />
I have a problem with ASPxCallback.<br />
In a projet, the user has to fill some ASPxTextBoxes. According to the values entered in these fields, other ASPxTextBoxes have to be updated automatically.<br />
To do that I use an ASPxCallback.<br />
 It perfectly works as long as, after having entered the value in the ASPxTextBox, I click on any point of the page .It also works if, after having entered the value, I press the Tab.<br />
 But, if after having entered the value, I press Enter, the ASPxCallback is not called at all.<br />
What is wrong in what I do?<br />
<br />
Please, find in attachement the related file.<br />

Many thanks.<br />

ASPxTreeList does not populate the Summary attribute for its data table and therefore is not compliant with WCAG 1.0-5.5,"<p>ASPxTreeList should populate the Summary attribute in the rendered datatable when the SummaryText property is populated.<br />
<br />
According to the documentation: &quot;The <strong>SummaryText</strong> property specifies the text, placed in the table tag, which will be picked up by browser-readers.&quot;</p><p><br />
<br />
To reproduce, create a tree list.  Set AccessibilityCompliant=&quot;true&quot; SummaryText=&quot;This is a test summary&quot;<br />

Run the application, and inspect the rendered HTML.  Notice that there is no summary attribute for the datatable.  This violates WCAG 1.0 - 5.5 Provide Summaries for Tables.<br />

Changing Portrait Page Setting to Landscape,"<p>Dear Support Team,<br />
<br />
       We are facing problem while printing document which has got Page Width is greater than Page Height. More over we are facing this problem only for <strong>Cannon Laser Shot LBP2900 series printers.</strong><br />
<br />
       For our report document, we had set Paper Kind as Custom, Page Width as 827, Page Height as 585 and Landscape = False.<br />
<br />
As i said above in all type of printer it is printing as expected except above printer. in this printer it is printing in landscape with somewhere on the corner of the paper.<br />
<br />
     After spending lot of time we found that this series printer doesn&#39;t support paper type which has got more width than height. if paper size has set more width than height in Xtra Reports printer is automatically changing to landscape mode.<br />
<br />
     But with reports created with other vendor application it is printing properly on the same printer. even with MS-Word it is printing properly.<br />
<br />
<br />
we are facing problem only with Xtra Reports.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please provide a solution to over come this.<br />

Changing series point highlight (hot-tracked) color and size,"<p>Hello!<br />
<br />
I have difficulties in changing the highlight color of a series point in a chart, during mouse hovering (HotTracking). <br />
<br />
I am building a point series chart and I am customizing its CustomDrawSeriesPoint event so that I can use different colors for the series points. <br />
In the end my chart will have points colored with red, orange, red, depending on some conditions. <br />
<br />
During hovering (hot tracking)  the series points, the highlight color of a hot-tracked point is always green, for every point (green is the default color for the series points). This is inconvenient. I would like that the point highlight color would remain the same. (red stays red, green stays green, orange stays orange during highlighting).<br />
<br />
Can this be accomplished somehow? Could you please guide me with some directions?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance. <br />

Chart bound to ObservableCollection does not update when collection members are updated,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a DXGrid and DXChart in different DockPanels in a DockLayoutManager. I am using MVVM and the Grid and chart are bound to the same Observable Collection in my view model. <br />
<br />
When I initialize and load items into the ObservableCollection the grid and chart both update accordingly and display the data.<br />
<br />
When I edit data in the grid, however, the chart is not updated. The Grid binding is set to TwoWay and data is definately changing becuase I am able to save changes to my back end database.<br />
<br />
If I call <p>chart.UpdateData();</p><br />
then the data in the Chart is refreshed and shows correctly, but it appears the binding is not working as expected. Its like the chart binding is always stuck in OneTime mode.<br />
<br />
Based on this answer this appears by design ?<br />

Color animation storyboard does not work in the 15.1 version if the MetropolisDark theme is used,"Hi<br /><br />I have a project (see the screenshot) where I'm updating a ColorBrush through an animation. The color is changed from yellow to green and back again or from yellow to red and also back again. Until now there hasn't been any problems  when updating from one version of DevExpress to another. But after moving from 14.2.6 to 15.1.3 the color won't change anymore.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have attached two small projects where you can see my problem. One of the projects is using 14.2.6 and working as it should. The other one is updated to version 15.1.3 and is NOT working. The color won't change anymore.<br /><br />Could you please try to solve the issue.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Lars<br /><br />"
Color Picker does not display the initial color correctly,"<p>We&#39;re having a problem with the initial position of the selector and slider on the color picker.  I&#39;ve attached an example of how we&#39;re using it currently. The initial color is set to RGB 201, 145, 103.  When you click on the popup and select &quot;More Colors&quot; to show the color picker, the color space it shows is incorrect.  It should be higher into the red part of the spectrum.  You can see this by clicking right on the location where it puts the selector by default.  The green value will jump to 174 or so, indicating that it&#39;s not showing the appropriate color space.<br />

Is there something we&#39;re doing wrong?  Is there any way to fix this?<br />

ColorDialogOptions - How to change icons in context menus,"<p>Hello DX,<br />
<br />
 I&#39;m creating my own derived ColorPickEdit. I do not add much functionality, it&#39;s just customized to our needs because we reuse the same editor over and over. Our application uses custom icons for copy/paste/cut that is usually in all context menus of the text editors. How can we change the context menu icons of the Red/Green/Blue/# texteditors from the ColorDialogOptions?<br />

Please see attached image to show exactly which I mean.<br />

Creating a custom table with the USER_TABLES name causes Data Source Wizard crash,I encountered an issue while trying to run the query builder in the dashboard suite. It would crash during initialization when using it with some of our Oracle databases. With others it would work fine.<br>It took me quite a while to get to the root of the problem but I evetually figured out that this was caused by some of our views and tables having the same name. In our case these were uninted relicts within our database that could easily be cleaned up.<br>What bothered me though was the full on crash it caused in our application plus the lack of information on the cause. Therefore I would like to suggest you add some error handling to prevent a crash and a more conclusive error message to your code.

 I can read the Theme colour matrix of the popup window displayed by the font colour picker within the richeditcontrol&#39;s ribbonbar (only by using the property named Property of the ChangeFontColorItem - which is marked as redundant in the docs). However, I am unable to set the theme colours. Is there any way I can set the theme colours for the font colour picker in the ribbon - what i wold like to do is give the user the option of selecting a set of theme colours. I&#39;ve found out how MS Word does this by converting the base colours to HSL and deriving the remaining colour swatches by altering the tinting and shading.<br />
<br />
Also, why do the font colour pickers used in various dialogs (Font Dialog, Edit Style Dialog, etc) not have the Office 2007 appearance - they simply display a 8 x 6 array of colour swatches and it makes it difficult to choose colours in these dialogs to be consistent with the colours selected via the ribbon&#39;s colour pickers. It would be far better to make all these colour pickers of the one style.<br />

Customization Form - Add skin support by replacing TPageControl with TcxPageControl,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Attached are images of the vertical grid customization form, and the grid customization form. I used valentine so it is dead obvious. Seems the vertical grid uses a TPageControl vs a TcxPageControl.<br />

Dashboard Export number is always formatted as Currency,"<p>The dashboard gives you formatting options for numbers that allow you to eliminate the dollar signs in the dashboard.  However, when you export to excel, no matter what your number format, there&#39;s a dollar sign in excel.<br />

Dashboard Item - Add a DropDown data selector item that supports filtering capabilities,"<p>As a more compact alternative to card view, I suggest you implement selectors / dropdowns, similar to this (SAP BusinessObjects):<br />
<a href=""http://resources.businessobjects.com/support/cx/samples/download_45/portable_interactive_model/Portable%20Interactive%20Visual%20Model.swf"">http://resources.businessobjects.com/support/cx/samples/download_45/portable_interactive_model/Portable%20Interactive%20Visual%20Model.swf</a><br />
 Or see attached picture. Selectors should be able to attach to each other, so that you never end up with an empty set, or be independent - have a fixed set of values, for performance. As an added benefit, it would be nice if you could multi-select. For example, in insurance, you would select multiple policy types to indicate you want all activity related to property.<br />
Depending on the number of items in the list, this new approach may save lots of on-screen space.<br />
Please also let me know if something like this is already on your list.  Thanks.</p>"

Is there a way to determine in the custom callbacks like when they are adding a condition/etc that we don't need to requery the database? In other words, we'd like them to be able to build their filter conditions but not query the database until they hit ""Apply/OK"" on the filter.

DataGrid loses the entered data in the editing form when expanding or collapsing another row,"Hello,<br><br><p>I discovered that there were some changes made between version 17.1.8 and 17.1.9 in the way dxDataGrid build-in forms are treated when rows are being expanded/collapsed.<br><br>Let me give you a simple scenario. Suppose a user is adding a new row. He or she enters the data and while filling up the form they decide to expand a row below to see its details and maybe use those info in adding. What is happening in newer version is that the adding form with all the data disappears irrevocably contrary to the previous version where the adding form stays untouched which is the expected behavior.<br><br>I've prepared some samples that demonstrate this. One for version&nbsp;<a href=""https://codepen.io/anon/pen/GBxoyv"">17.1.8</a> and the other for <a href=""https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qyoNGe"">17.1.9</a>. Please check it out.

Disable DeferredDeletion when using Business Class Library,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I am developing an application with three tiers of classes, based on the Task class, provided in the Devexpress Business Class Library.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s an Order class which derives from WorkItem which derives from Task.<br />
<br />
Task (BaseObject, ITask) -&gt; XPCustomObject with DeferredDeletion by default true<br />
WorkItem (Task)<br />
Order (WorkItem) <br />
<br />
When I create an Order and delete it. It is still in my database. That makes sense, because DeferredDeletion is set to true in the Task base class.<br />
<br />
However, when I add this attribute to the order class, it still is not immediately deleted from the database.<br />
[DeferredDeletion(false)] <br />
<br />
Probably because the DeferredDeletion of the Task is still in effect, but how can I override this behaviour?<br />
<br />
And is there a way to globally disable the DeferredDeletion option?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Docking does not work after dock panels located horizontally were auto-hidden and made floating,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a problem with DockPanel (XtraBars). Docking does not work after auto-hiding and floating a dock panel. <br />
<br />
In attached demo, if you <br />
1. Auto-hide DockPanel1<br />
2. Float DockPanel1<br />
3. Dock command in the context menu of DockPanel1 does not work anymore.<br />
<br />
The problem occurs only if the dockpanel was located before floating next to another dockpanel. I mean, panels were arranged horizontally. If panels were arranged vertically, Dock command works ok. The command works also if auto-hide was not done before floating.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m using DevExpress 13.1.6 for WinForms. Is this fixed in newer version? Or do you have ideas how I can fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

DocumentManager - A document's AllowClose option is being reset if the document is hosting DockPanel,"I have added a DockManger and DocumentManager to a form, and created 2 DockPanels as Tabbed Documents. In the designer, I set the ""AllowClose"" property to ""False"" on both the documents and the TabbedView. When I activated the documents programmatically the close button was coming back, so I added code after the ""activate"" to set the property back to False. Now, clicking from 1 tab to another is also setting the property back to ""True"", and I haven't found an event I can handle to set them back (I can see that the property is back to ""True"" in the DocumentManager.DocumentActivate event, but setting it back to ""False"" in that event doesn't work, the close button still appears."

DocumentManager and DockManager - It is impossible to completely disable floating,"<p>Hi!<br />
<br />
 I use DocumentManager and DockManager in my forms to place controls. I want to disable completely the possibility to float panels/documents. <br />
The view of the DocumentManager is TabbedView. I set the followings configurations to disable everything :<br />
<br />
tabbedView.DocumentProperties.AllowFloat = false;<br />
panel.Options.AllowFloating = false; (on each panels of the DockManager)<br />
<br />
First question : Is there a way to disable floating on the DockManager itself (DockManager.DockingOptions.AllowFloating = false or something like that). It is not really interesting to have to iterate of each panel to disable this function.<br />
<br />
Second question : It seems that floating is still working after that anyway. If I take a document (Fill), I can float it. Why ? Is there something I miss ?<br />
<br />
I read old posts that mentioned some bugs about Document Fill and Dock Panels float but it seems to be fixed since some times.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

"Duplicate records can be created when using SecuredObjectSpaceProvider or a middle-tier application server despite RuleUniqueValue, RuleObjectExists and other validation rules","<p>Hello support,<br />
<br />
 we use a SecuredObjectSpace, so that user A does not &quot;see&quot; all objects of a certain type T, whereas user B can see all these objects. User A can create new objects of type T. T contains a property having a RuleUniqueValue. As A does not see all objects of type T, the RuleUniqueValue does not consider the objects that A does not see. This leads to duplicate values for the said property. The duplicate values can only be seen by user B, who sees all objects.<br />
<br />
Can we do anything so that the RuleUniqueValue considers all objects, not only those visible to A?<br />

dxAutocomplete - Implement the searchMode option with available values: 'startWith' | 'contains',"<p>It might be intended, but the filterOperator property is missing from the <a href=""http://phonejs.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/Widgets/dxAutocomplete/Configuration?version=13_2"">dxAutocomplete</a> documentation.<br />

I had to search through the dx.all to find the property so I can change it. On a similar note, I feel like &quot;startswith&quot; should be the default operator, rather than &quot;contains&quot;, for dxAutocomplete. At least in my experience. But I suppose if the documentation for it is put out, it would be easier to change it anyway. <br />

The implementation provided in the above mentioned implementation doesn't work if the initial state of the checkbox is something other than undefined. <br>Case initial state ""false"": false =&gt; true =&gt; false =&gt; undefined =&gt; true<br>Expected: false =&gt; undefined =&gt; true<br>2. The behavior differs from the WPF CheckEdit, because the state of the CheckEdit flows like that: true =&gt; null/undefined =&gt; false<br><br>How can I match the WPF CheckEdit behavior to the DevExtreme dxCheckBox?<br><br>Please let me know if my concern is unclear.<br><br>Kind regards,<br>Steffen Probst "

dxCommand items rendered twice for location: 'menu' in iOS specific simulators,"<p>Hello DevExpress-Support-Team,<br />
<br />
there seems to be a problem where dxCommands get rendered double in the ios specific simulator devices, when the location of the dxCommands is set to &#39;menu&#39;.<br />
The behaviour can be seen in the KitchenSink-demo when following these steps:<br />
- open the <a href=""http://phonejs.devexpress.com/Demos/?url=KitchenSink"">KitchenSink-Demo</a><br />
- make sure that either iOS7 or iOS6 is selected, else select one of them<br />
- Click on &quot;Navigation&quot; in the menu<br />
- Click on the &#39;Menu&#39;-symbol on the top <strong>right</strong> corner<br />
<br />
--&gt; Every menu item is displayed twice<br />
<br />
The same problem occurs in other projects using DevExtreme 13.2.7<br />

dxDataGrid - Customize data grid column filters,"I am checking out DevExtreme (HTML JS) library to see if we can use this in one of the applications that we would be developing in Angular 2. We would be mostly using the data grid component. I found out that most of our requirements can be met using the DevExtreme data grid. But we would need to tweak the grid filter functionality so that it would align with our requirements (please check attached screenshot). Can you please let me know if this level of customization is possible in data grid? I made some effort to implement this using ""headerCellTemplate"" configuration of ""dxi-column"". But I am not able to display my filter menu popover properly as it is getting hidden because of the css - ""overflow:hidden"" that is applied to the parent html elements. Is there a way we can display the popover without having to override all this css. Or is there any other way to accomplish this? Please give me some pointers on how I should proceed with this."

I have a loadpanel in a view,... a simple loadPanel<br />

<code lang='html'>&lt;div data-bind=""dxLoadPanel: { visible: loadPanelVisible }""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>Then i just make loadPanelVisible(true) or (false) whenever an action is made to refresh a list. but for some reason, it doesn&#39;t work.<br />
On the browser (and android), doing it like so works for the first time, but then making it true again doesn&#39;t show it.<br />
<br />
So i made a work around in the browser and wrote in my js:<br />
<br />
<code lang='js'>var loader = new DevExpress.ui.dxLoadpanel (element, {visible: true}) ;
..
..
..
datasource.load().done( function () { loader.option('visible', false }; );</code>every time i need to show the loader. Now that made it work in the browser, but doesn&#39;t work on android.<br />
<br />
When i was using phonejs .2.7 it was working using the above js  method in android (the first method still didn&#39;t work) but now both methods don&#39;t work on android at all.<br />
<br />
I really need this loading panel since it takes up to 2 seconds to reload the list, and i need to show some feedback to the user.<br />

DXPrinting - DXGrid takes too much time on exporting to XLS\XLSX formats,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
 Export to excel (xls or xlsx) a table with approximately 3000 rows x 50 columns takes about 10 secs.  On a previous version of the system where we were using a different vendor, exporting the same amount of data took &lt; 1 sec.<br />
<br />
I am using the ExportToXls functionality of the TableView/TreeListControl.<br />
<br />
How can I speed this up?  I just want the data to be in an Excel spreadsheet without any bells or whistles.<br />

dxRangeSelector - How to set zoomed values,"<p>Is there a way to specify a starting &quot;zoom&quot; for the range selector?

Export - Asian characters are not displayed correctly when exporting to PDF,"<p>When using the Dashboard Viewer to export to PDF , Japanese characters are not displaying properly in the output.

I have a feeling it is strictly a font/font encoding issue, so if there was a way to set the font and font encoding used by the pdf exporter in code then I could properly work around the issue.

Feature request - Leverage DataAnnotations to ease Winforms validation definition,"<p>More and more frequently in our applications, the model layer (what will be bound in the views) are shared between web and desktop applications.<br />
<br />
Using asp.net mvc, we are used to DataAnnotations - <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.aspx"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.aspx</a><br />
<br />
It would be nice if the bindings used by the winforms components could one way or another use the validations defined through the dataAnnotation attributes, preventing code duplication for similar validations. <br />
<br />
The result could work like jquery.validate - <a href=""http://jqueryvalidation.org/"">http://jqueryvalidation.org/</a> and the MSFT unobstrusive plug-in <a href=""http://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation/"">http://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation/</a> : translate DataAnnotation errors to UI.<br />

Field filter with single selection ListBox - Radio mode filter,"<p>Hi<br />

I have just started using he DevExpress toolkit and so far I am very impressed.<br />

I have built a pivot table but I would like to change the filter elements to single select listboxes that show the current selection. I have attached a screen shot (pivotscreen.jpg) and I would like to change the top 3 filters (ie Period Desc, Year and Report Group) to listboxes that show the current selection. I have attached the result I am looking for (pivotscreen2.jpg) Is this possible? If so do you have any example code?

Find out required vertical/horizontal size of a layout control,"Hi.<br><br>I have a form which I dynamically compose at runtime  out of different frames. One (actually several) of the frames has a dx layout control which contains several edits which are shown/hidden depending on some other variables.

I would like to find out what these values are, so I can change the size of the control containing the frame to initially display the layout control without scrollbars. Please note that I would prefer not to use the AutoSize (if it is usable in this case) feature, because the frame containing the layout control is itself contained in another layout item of an ""outer"" control.<br><br>So after constructing and placing the frames I would like to ask the layout control how large it would have to be to display all its content without using scrollbars.<br><br>Example:<br>dxOuterLayoutItem.Height = innerLayoutControl.GetOptimalHeight();<br><br>I attached to screenshots to make things clearer.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>"

Flickering when summary values are updated,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I am using group and total summaries in a grid.  Both of these use the DisplayFormat to format the summary text.  When I update the data in the grid with AllowLiveDataShaping=true the total summary text flickers as it refreshes.  The group summary does not flicker and is good.<br />
<br />
I have attached a sample and if you run it and use the drop downs in the grid these update the grid values that the summaries are calculated from.  When you do this you will see the total summary flicker each time it updates.  If you have a slower machine you will see that the total summary looks like it gets blanked and redrawn each time.<br />

FormLayout is not resized correctly with the ListBox width set to 100% and placed into the Bootstrap panel,"<p>Hi Support Team,<br />
<br />
The issue looks related to <a href=""https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/Q578989"">this one</a>, but for the Form Layout with two list boxes. <br />
<br />
<br />
When there is one list box within Form Layout, it resizes properly. However when I add second list box and set its width to Unit.Percentage(100), on resize the form layout content become wider than its parent panel.<br />
To reproduce resize the browser window, to make it narrow, then expand,<br />
Sample project is attached.<br />
<br />
If there is no quick workaround or the way to resize it properly, which controls can you suggest to use in place of this broken ones? This issue is too noticable to tolerate for user.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

Grid - AutoFilterRow filtering issue with the Croatian culture,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Attached is a project to better explain my problem.<br />
I&#39;ve created a drop down filter. Some segments of code might be familiar to you since I&#39;ve made use of multiple articles from your knowledge base in order to implement all the desired functionality. (Excuse the foreign sounding solution name, I&#39;ve hastily reused a test environment for this purpose)<br />
<br />
The issue I have is that the auto filter row  filtering does not work as I&#39;d expect for AutoFilterCondition.Contains FilterMode. The 2 users I did notice the problems I have added to the filter data in this example (mostly, didn&#39;t remember the exact names but the issue is there nontheless). <br />
<br />
On filtering for the &#39;vil&#39; string, only one of the entries is shown in the view, but on filtering for the &#39;vilj&#39; string, a different entry is shown (and both contain the &#39;vil&#39; substring).<br />
My question is whether or not this is by design and there is a property I didn&#39;t set that would fix this problem, or is this a bug (with hopefully a workaround)?<br />
<br />
With Regards, <br />

GridControl - Create a RepositoryItemComboBox item for columns with the enum type,"<p>As some data types are automatically bound  (without specifying  it  in the property ColumnEdit)  to default editor when it makes sens (bool,dateTime,...), why are not enumerations automatically bound to a combo/list editor ?<br />
<br />
I think it is a pity, since the system doesn&#39;t have the choice but to match any input of the user  with values from the enum ; why stoping good stuff here. Automatically binding it to a list editor (without specifying  it  in the property ColumnEdit) will save a lot of time in many cases.<br />

GridControl - Editors are shown for a focused row when selecting multiple rows on any ModifierKey press,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a question about the multiselection mode in grid and tree. Is it by design that for the focused row (at least it seems so) the editors are shown while holding shift or ctrl? For other rows than the focused row no editors are shown. For us the second case would be the right one, but for all rows (also the focused). The current behavior sometimes leads to unwanted changes of values (e.g. checkboxes) by the user. Since fixing the ticket Q557466 the tree behaves similiar to the grid. <br />
Do you also agree that no editors should be shown for the focused row while holding shift or ctrl? If so will you change the current behavior?<br />
I have attached a video, which demonstrates that especially for the ctrl key the behavior is very confusing (the test solution is also attached).<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Best regards,<br />
Matthias</p>"

Is there a way to determine in the custom callbacks like when they are adding a condition/etc that we don't need to requery the database? In other words, we'd like them to be able to build their filter conditions but not query the database until they hit ""Apply/OK"" on the filter.

How do I hide unnecessary nodes in the application Model Editor from end-user?,"<p>Hello!<br />
<br />
I need to remove unnecessary Nodes from end-user Application Model Editor . I want to see all Nodes while debugging application in Visual Studio or using standalone version of Application Model Editor, but hide most of them when user opens built-in Application Model Editor.<br />
<br />
Ideally, i need to remove all nodes, associated with default XAF modules and let user see only those that was created in application modules or my custom modules. It includes nodes from BOModel and Views mostly, since all other nodes can be used by end-user, but system objects and their BOModel and Views is unnecessary for end-user (like ReportData BO and Views).<br />
<br />
My end-users complain alot about many Nodes that they dont actually use when modifying Application Model, so i want to make it better for them.<br />

How to avoid that the gridview`s detailview auto scrolls up on last line click?,"<p>Hi!</p><p>I am having a problem with the XtraGrid in the Master-Detail mode.</p><p>When there are more rows than will fit in a detailview, and I click on the last one, the detailview automatically scrolls up one row.

 The problem is that I am using the GridControlStates and GridCheckMarkSelection helper dlls supplied by DevExpress and, because of this automatic up scrolling, the next rows get sellected and not the one clicked. See attached video.<br />

Just before you start redirecting me to similar questions I would like to emphasize, that I have already spent two days searching and investigating similar devexpress tickets like these:<br />
<a href=""http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/Q435183"">http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/Q435183<br />
</a><a href=""http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/Q353853"">http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/Q353853</a> <br />
<br />
but just did not managed to make it work - the main difference is that I am creating progressbar via EditSettings and I need override color of the progressbar value bar, and not the background color of the progress bar.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for the reply,<br />

How to connect to a data service behind a firewall,"Hi,<br /><br />I was wondering if you guys could help me get my head around a solution for our future product. We own DevExtreme Complete. After all the research I believe it is the one we will use for our mobile project.<br /><br />Our customers data are internal to their network running on MySQL on our server, behind the firewall. No ports can be opened, however, we need to get to that data in order for our mobile project to work.<br /><br />So far I have this figured out:<br /><br />Inside their network on our server we would create a service (service1)&nbsp;using .net. This will be a restful web service (ASP.NET Rest API? DevExtreme WCF OData Service? --need maybe a suggestion here)&nbsp;. It will connect to another service outside the network (service2). To this web service will the clients connect to running the DevExtreme Mobile application either on a phone, tablet, or a website.<br /><br />Service2&nbsp;will forward the requests down to service1, service1 grabbing the data and sending it back&nbsp;to service2, which in turn will forward it to the clients.<br /><br />Am I looking at this correctly?<br /><br />Any thoughts would be really helpful."

How to disable or reduce TdxRibbonBackstageView close delay?,"Hi,<br><br>I am implementing the TdxRibbonBackstageView in my application and notice that the menu takes to much time to close.<br>Even in my super fast machine it takes to long.<br>In slower machines it is more noticeable and it will be a problem since many customers have very slow computers.<br><br>Testing the same behavior in Office 2016, the menu closes almost immediately and the app main screen show up instantly. Which means that this is not the design behavior of the Office 2016 UI.<br>The problem doesn't seem to be exactly while the menu is closing, but more about the time that takes to show the main app screen again right after the menu disappears.<br>This is weird since I also have my app with tabs, so every app screen show inside a TcxTabSheet on the main form. And switching between tabs is very fast and the screen draws quickly.<br>And at least I would expect the same speed when the&nbsp;TdxRibbonBackstageView menu closes and the main form shows it's content again.<br><br><br>Can we disable the animation to make the menu to close without delay?<br>The animation when it opens it's not bad, but it would also be nice if we could adjust the animation delay.<br><br>I hope I could have explained this issue well enough.<br><br><br>Thanks.<br><br><br>Luis Madaleno<br>"

How to display the Group Header information when a single Series is displayed,"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
 I have created many successful charts using the DevExpress.ExpressApp.Chart.Win.ChartListEditor EditorType on list views, however i am having some issues with the stacked bar chart.<br />
<br />
I have a chart which displays a count, on the x-axis i have the clients name and on the y-axis i have the total count. I wish to group the items by the project that they correspond to, this works perfectly fine when a client has 2 or more projects being displayed, it will display the clients name, and all of the projects and their values when i hover my mouse over the bar, however when i hover  my mouse over a bar with just one project in, it returns the value and the name of the client however not the name of the project, this is an issue i am having on all of my stacked bar charts when the bar only has one unique series being returned into is. Is there any way around this.?<br />

I do not see in your example a scenario like mine.<br /><br />Eg in this example: https://demos.devexpress.com/ASPxNavigationAndLayoutDemos/FormLayout/DataBindingToDatabase.aspx<br /><br />This example speaks for update and it just has a ASPXLayout. I will like to know how to do an Insert () to a form that contains several ASPXLayoutForm.<br /><br />Thank you for your help.<br />Daniel </p>"

How to set a DevExtreme package name,"<p>I built an application using DevExtreme and successfully put it on ios and android devices  in development mode without issue.  In the GENERAL tab of the project properties there is a property called Application Title.  I set this to UPCIC.  When I copy the android APK to my phone and install it the app shortcut on the phone was named UPCIC.   This is what I want.   I then deployed the android app to the play store and I then installed it from there and the app shortcut was the name of the project or name of the apk whichever one it seemed to pull it from:   UPCICMobile.Mobile.   Is there something I am missing that it does not act the same when downloaded from the play store.   I am worried now that once the apple app store approves my binary that it will have the same issue.  <br />

How to set the control alignment when using LayoutControl/DataLayoutControl,"<p>I have a general question about How to layout the controls when using the DataLayout Control.  VS shows alignment guides when you place a control on the WinForm.  The DataLayout seems to split the line if you are putting two controls on the same line.  But I wanted to align two rows vertically that are not evenly split, I am not sure how to do it.  Eyeballing it seems to be an inaccurate approach.  I was wondering if there was something  that I was missing in how to use these two controls.  Otherwise I guess I would go back to placing each control individually on the form.<br />

"How to set the Width, Height, IsMaximized and other form properties to control the window size","<p>Hi,<br />

One of the elements of the parameters comes up as a combo box, which pops open - and unfortunately the popup window doesn&#39;t have enough room for the combo box popup, so that suddenly a scroll bar is displayed when the combo box opens.

What would you suggest to allow me to specify a greater height for the popup window than what is allocated automatically, in order to make room for the combo to pop open without the scrollbar issue?<br />

How to synchronize a record pointer between GridView and DataSource,"<p>Hi,<br />
I have a problem, and can&#39;t exact reproduce it but<br />
<br />
in first case, xtragrid has data, and when I change a row, the binded datasource also change a row.<br />
When I add new row to datasource, grid automaticaly focus new row at the bottom of the grid!<br />
All works as expected.<br />
<br />
<br />
But.. half of classes, has absolutely other behavior.. but was developed for same use.<br />
In this case - when I change row in the grid - dasource still has old row pointer.<br />
When I add new row to the datasource, the focused row in Grid not changed, and new row appears somewhere at the bottom of the grid, but never focused.<br />
<br />
I spend couple days and still can&#39;t find the solution, but I found difference in call stack!<br />
<br />
In bad case, after ColumnView.DoChangeFocusedRowInternal() - RaiseFocusedRowChanged happens.. and row pointers are not synchronized.<br />
<br />
In good case after ColumnView.DoChangeFocusedRowInternal() -  XtaGrid.Views.GridView.DoChangeFocusedRow happens - all all works fine as expected.<br />
<br />
I add the stack pictures.. Picture 1 (BAD) ... Picture 2 (GOOD)<br />

How to update custom themes after upgrading a project to a new version using ASPxThemeBuilder,"<p>If you have been actively using our ASP.NET components in your web applications for a long time, I am sure you encountered difficulties with updating a custom theme. This article will help you avoid these and thus save your time and booster productivity.<br />
We introduce new features in all our major releases. Every new feature requires upgrading HTML markup of an ASP.NET control. As a result, CSS classes and styles are also modified according to changes made in the markup. This is not a problem if your application uses only default DevExpress themes. However, a custom theme created based on one of DevExpress themes should be upgraded manually. I would like to show you an approach that might help you make the process easier.</p>"

How to use column caption instead of data field in filter expression,"Hi, <br><br>I am currently evaluating possibility to use dxDataGrid in my application, which will be using a remote data source. The remote data source (API) is able to filter data, but the filter engine expects actual values/titles, not keys. For example, for such a field: <br><br><code lang=""js"">{
   caption: 'My.Name with strang/e character-s.',
   dataField: 'dfName',
}</code><br>the API would expect filter to be provided for the ""My.Name with strang/e character-s."" field, not ""dfName"".<br>The same applies to lookup values - the filter engine expects lookup texts to be used in filter, not the internal values. <br><br>Because of this fact I would need to process the filter expression used in the grid before sending to the API and perform the required conversions. <br>Are there any ""tools"" available to perform/simplify such a conversion? I mean something similar to DevExpress.Data.Filtering.Helpers.INodeVisitor or DevExpress.Data.Filtering.ICriteriaVisitor that I use to modify CriteriaOperator filters in C# code.<br><br><br>greetings<br>Bartek <br>"

How to use the Postgres database with EasyTest,"<p>I&#39;m eveluating using EasyTest in our Jenkins CI server and encountered a few problems on the way.<br />

1. Not really an error, but just out of curisoity, why does EasyTest require admin privilege?<br />
2. I tried to use LocalDB but couldn&#39;t get DropDB working with it. Is it not supported at the moment or is my configuration wrong?<br />
<code lang='xml'>		&lt;Database xsi:type=""TestMSSQLDatabase"" Server=""(LocalDB)\v11.0"" DBName=""SchulungEasyTest""/&gt;

<br />
4. Why is the source code of the TestExecutor missing?<br />
5. We really want to test with the database engines we plan to use (Sybase SQL Anywhere, SQLite, Postgres), so the support of only SQL Server or MS Access for DropDB and RestoreDB renders them ununsable for us. That&#39;s not that big of a problem, we just have to deal with the database outside of EasyTest.<br />

Improve the scaling of DevExpress controls and skinnable standard controls at high DPI settings (more than 96),"<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
 I noticed, that when I have a skinned TcxCheckbox, it looks fine when view on regular 100% display scaling (96 DPI) but is displayed too small when viewed on 200% (192 DPI). So what is the preferred way to make a skinned TcxCheckbox (or TcxRadiobutton) look consistent independent of DPI scaling? (when skinning is deactivated, the control resizes as expected)<br />
<br />
To create a sample, place a regular TCheckbox on a form with active skinning (I used skin &#39;Seven&#39;) and place a TcxCheckbox too. Then run on a system with 96DPI/100% and then on a system with 192DPI/200% and check the appearance.<br />
<br />
Attached is a screenshot of what I can see on my systems.<br />

It is impossible to access horizontal and vertical border settings of selection,"<p>Hi DevExpress,<br />
I&#39;ve created a dialog that allows me to set the inside horizontal and inside vertical border settings (line style and colours) for a multicell selection.<br />
Prior to displaying said dialog from the popup context menu, I thought I would attempt to get the selection&#39;s current inside horizontal and vertical border settings so I could use them to initialise the dialog.<br />
<br />
When I use the following code<br />
<br />
Dim pCurrentSelection As Range = spreadEdit.Selection<br />
<br />
This works:<br />
                Trace.WriteLine(pCurrentSelection.Borders.LeftBorder.LineStyle.ToString) eg prints &#39;None&#39;<br />
 <br />
This gives an ugly error message:<br />
                Trace.WriteLine(pCurrentSelection.Borders.InsideHorizontalBorders.LineStyle.ToString)<br />
<br />
So am I doing it correctly - how do you obtain the inside horizontal and vertical border settings for a selection?<br />

"LayoutView - When the MultiColumn Mode is used and the MaxCardColumns and MaxCardRows properties are set, cards are not arranged according to the maximal row count if a grid has a large width","<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a Grid in LayoutView  set to show 3x3 cards, but when I resize the window, the view changes to a list. I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s by design and if so I&#39;d like to know why ?<br />
<br />
To reproduce the behaviour, simply add a GridControl to any form.  Set the properties OptionsMultiRecordMode.MaxCardColumns = 3, OptionsMultiRecordMode.MacCardRows = 3 and OptionsView.ViewMode = MultiColumn. Then, you only have to resize the designer window to witness the behavior I&#39;m talking about in the &#39;Sample View&#39;. If the window is small enough, the 3x3 matrix is visible as desired, but as soon as the window is enlarge sufficiently for a 4th card to fit on the 1st row, the view changes. Now only 1 row is visible, containing the cards of the 1st column.<br />
<br />
 By comparison, if you change the property OptionsView.ViewMode to MultiRows and resize the window, the behaviour is as I would expect. The 3x3 matrix stays the same no matter what.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any explanation.<br />

Legend - `getLayoutOptions` and `shift` methods work wrong,The `getLayoutOptions` method returns *width* and *height* which are not equal (both greater)&nbsp;to actual width and height of legend.<br />Width and height should be measured at legend's border.<br /><br />The `shift` method considers top-left corner of the first square symbol as the origin of the legend.<br />It should consider top-left corner of the border as the origin.<br /><br />Also method should be renamed - *shift* means *relative movement* rather than *absolute positioning* (which actually happens).

List of critical vulnerabilities found and solved in DevExpress ASP.NET products,For several last years we discovered several vulnerabilities in our ASP.NET WebForms controls. Some of them affects MVC Extensions too. This article lists the vulnerabilities with some additional details.
ListViewProcessCurrentObjectController - Throw a more descriptive exception when an object to be shown in a DetailView cannot be found in the target ObjectSpace,"<p>ListViewProcessCurrentObjectController.ShowObject may call Application.CreateDetailView with an empty object, which leads to ArgumentNullException. This happens when the original object is saved within the nested object space only but the target object space is not a nested object space, and also when the object is non-persistent.</p>"
Live preview in the form drifts when hovering with the mouse over the thumbnail preview in the taskbar,"<p>I have attached a movie and the sample program.<br />
<br />
 When you hover over the image in the thumbnail preview in the taskbar, the image is also showed in the form.<br />
<br />
This image has not a good position. The best way to see it, is when you have created a vertical group in the main window.<br />
<br />
You see that the splitter is dissapeared under the image of the form.</p>"

LookupEdits Embedded in FlyoutPanel Disappear When Columns Are Defined without field names,"<strong>Description<br /></strong>When using a FlyoutPanel control, if I embed two lookup edits in the control and manually define the columns for both (defaulting to the .ToString representation), the second lookup edit control added disappears from view and cannot be interacted with.<br /><br />Essentially, the dataset which is returned from the method I use to populate the lookup edits is a little richer than I need. I'd like to reduce the number of columns to a single column, that of the .ToString representation of the objects in the list I use for data binding. I am using the LookUpEdit Task window to access the column editor to define that column, binding it to the value I want to display and clearing out FieldName to force it to use that representation. This works, but if I try to follow the same pattern for a second column only one of the controls appears on the flyout panel.&nbsp;<br /><br />The attached project demonstrates this behavior using a Dictionary.<br /><strong><br />Desired Behavior<br /></strong>To have both controls appear with the defined columns.<br /><strong><br /> </strong>"

However, the actual value of the month level in the heirarchy is correct. <br />
<br />
Why is this happening. -- it this a bug with Dashboard Designer, or is there a problem with the heirarchy of our cube? Please let us know, we are holding off making the dashboards available until this is resolved...<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>"

Multi-thread support in DevExpress controls,"<p>We are trying to add support for binding to concurrent lists.  We can achieve this quite easily by using BindingOperations.EnableCollectionSynchronization on our concurrent lists.  This works great with our non-DevEx WPF controls.  However, it doesn&#39;t work with our DevEx controls due to the implementation of DevExpress.Xpf.Core.Native.SyncCollectionHelper (in our case, used by DevExpress.Xpf.Core.ItemsAttachedBehaviorCore).  SyncCollectionHelper only supports ILockable, which doesn&#39;t work for us because our custom collection implementations are in assemblies that know nothing of UI, and ILockable only exists in DevExpress.Xpf.Core.  Is it possible add support for a custom collection synchronization callback similar to BindingOperations.EnableCollectionSynchronization and BindingOperations.AccessCollection?<br />
<br />
Also,  SyncCollectionHelper.SyncCollection doesn&#39;t guarantee a call to BeginPopulate/EndPopulate, resulting in non-thread-safe access to the target collection.</p>"

NavBarControl  - Provide the capability to automatically select the first or last clicked item in NavBar when a user changes groups,"<p>Guys,<br />
<br />
The control designer forms new look is great, but I really cannot congratulate you on choosing an Outlook-styled navigation pane to browse through features. This control is perfect in Outlook because it brings up a contextual helper panel for the selected group. In your designers though, it&#39;s merely a treeview substitute, where only one node can be opened at a time.<br />
<br />
This is especially unefficient considering most of your designers groups only contains one or two elements. Not only this results in a lot of wasted space, it also makes moving back and forth between designer pages often requiring a second click that shouldn&#39;t be necessary.<br />
<br />
If you really insist on keeping that awkward navigation paradygm, would you please at least make it so that when clicking a group, it&#39;s first element gets automatically selected? That would already be a lot better.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>"

Something is wrong with keyboard navigation, as far as the new item row is concerned.

NullReferenceException thrown when editing an XPCollection item in DXPropertyGrid,"<p>Hello,<br />
recently I have come across an interesting issue. I have some XPO objects which I am trying to display in WPF property grid. Everything works fine until I call the Save() method upon the XPO object. After it, null reference exception is often thrown from XtraVerticalGrid .<br />
<br />
I could not find the direct source of the exception, so I started to debug DevExpress dlls and came to this conclusion:<br />
<br />
After the XPBaseObject is saved, PropertyChanged is fired like this:<br />
<br />
TriggerObjectChanged(new ObjectChangeEventArgs(Session, this, ObjectChangeReason.Reset));<br />
<br />
this event continues to DevExpress.Xpo.PersistentBase.TriggerObjectChanged() method where reason &quot;Reset&quot; is changed to call RaisePropertyChangedEvent(null);<br />
 <br />
the code further bubbles threw call stack (see the picture attached) up to the DevExpress.XtraVerticalGrid.Data.FieldNameHelper.GetFieldName() method where propertyName parameter is passed as null, and therefore null reference exception is thrown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that really a mis-conception between WPF property grid and XPO, or am I just using the assemblies incorrectly?<br />

ODataStore does not support case-insensitive filters,"<p><br />
Hi,<p>I am building a Basic DXTREME Application  and I&#39;m using ODataStore as datasource for my dxlists. I filter my ODatastore as described in your documentation at this link <a href=""http://help.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/Documentation/Howto/Data_Stores#Data_Stores_Advanced_Queries_Filter"">http://help.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/Documentation/Howto/Data_Stores#Data_Stores_Advanced_Queries_Filter</a><br />
It&#39;s working but I wonder how to  make operators &quot;startswith&quot; and &quot;contains&quot; to be case-insensitive. <br />
Reading OData documentation I discovered that there are functions like tolower and toupper  that may help but I don&#39;t know how to apply these functions to filter operators. <br />
Could you provide me an example on how to filter an ODataStore using &quot;startswith&quot; and &quot;contains&quot; operators in case-insensitive way?<br />
Thank you </p><p></p></p>"

ORM Data Model Designer problem (A file or folder with the name 'modelCode' already exists on disk at this location),"<p>Hi<br />
<br />
 We have detected bug in BO Designer. When we try to save Model diagram sametimes it displays error message (see attachment).<br />
To solve problem we have to close Visual Studio and remove folder modelCode. <br />
<br />
Probably this is some temp folder created by BO designer before update files in proper directory. In some cases designer is not able to remove it.<br />
<br />
Maybe solution is to check that folder is empty and use it instead of displaying error. In current solution designer displays this message and work is lost.<br />

Out of the box mobile compatibility of DevExtreme,"Hi All,<br> <br>We're running into some issues with the out of the box compatibility of Dev Extreme, as well as clear presentation of styles on desktop as well.<br>Basically all of the built in styles are failing our usability testing as a result, and material themes are especially deficient in the way of clarity. Going forward, we're looking for more of a way to minimize customization for basic usability. Very simply a theme must pass the squint test to pass our usability testing. When you create any kind of visible control that has a low opacity, even if it's for a disabled control that is visible, people still need to be able to see it clearly, and currently cannot with your themes.  I'd really suggest consulting with a person who can q/a your controls from a readability perspective and run with these as well as standard ARIA recommendations. <br> <br>Thanks,<br> <br>-David<br> "

PageAdornerControl - How to show custom buttons on the right side,"Hi,<br><br>I was wondering how I can add buttons on the right side of the PageAdornerControl.

            &lt;Layout:PageAdornerControl.HeaderTemplate&gt;

                &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;/Layout:PageAdornerControl.HeaderTemplate&gt;
</code><br>I don't understand where the RightHeader binding is refering to. Because it's just written ""Binding"". So I have no idea how I can add several buttons on the right side.<br><br>Coming from a delphi background, I still find the xaml learning curve still very steep. I was wondering what you guys use as a xaml reference? Most of the books just show very simple examples, but no complex layouts.<br><br>Hope u have a small sample about the PageAdornerControl with buttons that works with the code from the HybridApp?<br><br>Many, many thanks in advance, best regards, Nico<br><br> "

PivotGridControl - How to edit cells,"Hello,<br /><br />for our application, I've used the DXPivotGrid to display the status of different products in our different portals.<br /><br />This PivotGrid is supposed to show whether a product is online in a portal, has been changed after set to ""online"" or not online at all (offline).<br /><br />Now I want our users to be able to select online products to be taken offline, changed products to be refreshed and offline products to be uploaded.<br /><br />Furthermore:<br />- I am not able to see the selected cells (probably due to the cell style)<br />- The cell style does not show in printing mode (it shows the enum value instead)<br />- How can I add bar items to the&nbsp;<em>dxpg:PivotGridControl.CellMenuCustomizations</em>&nbsp;that pass the&nbsp;ProductMatrixItem as a CommandParameter?

Provide a way to calculate Unbound Fields at the summary level,"<p>We have a data set which contains highly normalised data - there is only a single numerical column, and the meaning of that column is defined in other columns. For example, we have mineral content and total mass as separate metrics, and we would use the metric name as column headings in the pivot grid. However, customers do not think in terms of mineral content - they always talk in terms of mineral grade, in parts per million - so it is imperative that we are able to report those values. One way around this is to generate cross tab views, with calculated fields to determine the grades, but this is no good for data in pivot tables because you cannot simply sum the grades when the pivot aggregates multiple rows. The calculation must be done on the aggregated content &amp; total fields.<br />
<br />
At the moment, the closest thing you have is pie charts, but they are only useful for values in the percentage range, not for parts per million.<br />
<br />
Please please please, will you consider adding a mechanism for calculated columns, where the value in a column is calculated based on the values shown in other cells on the same row.

Provide a way to display Percentage values in Pivot Grid and other items,"<p>I have a question that I&#39;m not sure there is an answer for (but I&#39;m hoping there is!)<br />
<br />
When using the great new Dashboard component, I have hit a problem I have had  before with grids and pivot grids, and have resolved the problem with custom summary functions, but with Dashboard its more problematical. I&#39;m talking about aggregated summary values.<br />
<br />
Lets suppose I have a data source that give me the sale value of a product and its cost price at the time of the sale. To get the margin on the sale price I use the following formula:<br />
<code lang='cs'>((salePrice - costePrice)  * 100) / salePrice</code> This is fine individually, but once I aggregate the value on a monthly basis, I need the sum of the salePrice&#39;s and the sum of the costePrice&#39;s to make the calculation valid.<br />
<br />
My question is: how can I achieve this on a &#39;general&#39;  aggregation basis?<br />
<br />
The user may wish to aggregate but month of the sale, the quarter , by department etc. so I can&#39;t put calculated margins for all these criteria.<br />

Since XtraPrinting can sign a document, but there is no options to make the signature visible (I had created a different ticket on this subject <a href=""https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/Q534202"">Q534202</a>), or to use a time stamp server, I use a diferent library to sign the PDF.<br />
<br />
After that the signed PDF is either sent to the customer by email or printed to be sent by postal mail - and this is my problem: since the &quot;printed-on-paper&quot; document is in fact the copy of a digitally signed document my customer requires that the physical document has a &quot;printed&quot; signature that relates to the digital signature.<br />
<br />
I was expecting to use PDF viewer to provide the printing engine to this task - but without the signature beeing visible, I can&#39;t use it.<br />

Questions about SPA framework in DevExtreme demos,"I hope to explain my question because I do not speak English very well .<br /><br />I have reviewed the DEVAV example and I have taken as a baseline and I learned a lot.<br /><br />On this example I developed a prototype for proof of concept and then apply them on my real platform. You on the ticket ID: T249599 (about dictionaries) I indicate that I only use widgets and do not use the framework.<br />Here starts my doubts about the framework ...<br /><br />1. The demo dxhotels indicates that is developed with spa framework. reviewed the structure is very similar to devav. even by the use of libraries dx. Between these two do not distinguish a difference of a project with spa framework.<br />2. Check the documentation for SPA Framework, but when you create the project was created as if for a mobile application and what I want is a web application that is not giving me the option to do so for a browser as it is devav or dxhotels. My conclusion was that not serving me.<br /><br />I ask you patience with his answers because in addition to the difficulty of the tool adds the fact that I do not speak English and there is no support in Spanish.<br />Thank you very much for your answers.&nbsp;"

ResourcesTree incorrectly expands/collapses nodes after switching from GanttView to MonthView,"Hello:<br><br>I've come across a pretty strange issue with the ResourceTree in association with the scheduler control. Attached I have provided a very simple solution that uses the ribbon, scheduler control and resourcetree. It would seem when collapsing the the nodes in the resource tree while in the gantt view, after switching back to the month view,  the collapse/expand feature of the tree becomes erratic. To reproduce the behavior please follow the steps below:<br><br>1. Run the winforms app<br>2. Observe the  expanded tree on the left<br>3. Switch to the gantt view <br>4. Collapse the root node<br>5. Switch to the month view <br>6. Observe the root node is still collapsed (works as expected)<br>7. Expand the root node (works as expected)<br>8. Collapse the ""A"" node  (works as expected)<br>9. Expand the ""A"" node  =&gt; At this point it collapses the root node and from here the tree does not work as expected as it never expands the child nodes and always collapses the root node<br><br>If you would like a video please let me know. Some of our users have very detailed complex trees and this behavior is pretty painful even though it seems small. "

Scale breaks on Y-Axis stopped working if RangeControl is linked to Chart,"<p>I had successfully implemented scale breaks on the Y-Axis of a chart.  This was initially not working at all, but I looked up a few tickets here on this issue and found a solution which recommended turning off all scrolling - so I got it to work by turning off scrolling and zooming on both X and Y Axes. However, charts that were displaying the Y-Axis scale break have now stopped doing so after I upgraded to either version 12.2.4 or 12.2.5. ( I haven&#39;t checked it after upgrading to version 12.2.4 but it is possible that this issue may have been there since - I know for sure that it was working before version 12.2.4).<br />
Was there a fix made to the original issue (which required all scrolling to be turned off) with some new property added that I need to take care of in my code?<br />

SelectBox - The scrolling feature works incorrectly after angular routing,"<p>Hi,<br> <br> We are having a issue with every single DxSelectBox in our application.

After that, the number of items scrolled by a single&nbsp;scroll wheel movement increases every time a new feature module is loaded. With dozens of feature modules loaded a single scroll wheel movement moves the scroll straight to the end.</p>  <p>In our application we have a shared module where we export all the devextreme modules that we use. Every feature module in our application imports this shared module. Most of the feature modules are also lazy loaded and I think this is the root of the problem.

Solution for creating custom XRControls when dragging fields in End-User-Designer does not work with multiple fields selected,"Hi&nbsp;<br><br>The solution in&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/T611591/report-design-drag-and-drop-field-list-and-add-with-component"">T611591</a>&nbsp;works like a charm as long as the 17.2 functionlity of drag'n'drop of multiple fields at a time is not used.<br><br>In this scenario it kind of unpredictable.

In other words, only row 11 should be editable to start off with.<br><br>What I am trying to do is to restrict the 'Insert Row' and 'Delete Row' commands so that the insert row command will always add a row at the end of this table and nowhere else.

Also so that the delete row command will only work if the highlighted row is within the table.<br><br>I am very new to this control and am a bit perplexed as to how to achieve this at the moment.

Task dependencies are drawn incorrectly on scrolling the Gantt View,"<p>Dear Support Team,<br />
<br />
I&#39;m working on a resource planner application to schedule jobs with several work items for different resources. The database contains all of the appointments, resources and dependencies without overlapping between jobs. When I open the Gantt view to see the appointments (work items) with the corresponding dependencies, I realized that, the drawing of dependency lines depends on the horizontal scrolling of the view - the reorganization of the visible appointments may have effect on it. The problem is, that the visualisation of relationship changes: the appointments of two different jobs gets mixed in a specific point of the scolling - see the attached images.<br />
Is there any workaround, or may I missed something regarding dependencies?<br />
Thank you in advance!<br />

TcxScrollBox - AV when continuously panning a control embedded into the scroll container,"<p>Hi. <br />

When using the cxScrollBox there is an AccessViolation when scrolling on an touch screen device. <br />

The Color Picker does not display the initial color correctly,"<p>We&#39;re having a problem with the initial position of the selector and slider on the color picker.

The grid View grouped by a column whose OnGetProperties event is handled displays duplicate group rows if dcoSortByDisplayText is set in the View's DataController.Options option set,"<p>Hello.<br />
<br />
Based on <a href=""https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/Q562746"">https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/Q562746</a> one of my columns uses the GetProperties event to show different values in the filter builder dialog.<br />

If you enable the GridView.DataController.Options.dcoSortByDisplayText property, grouping by that column shows duplicated entries, if you don&#39;t order by that column prior to grouping.<br />

The Grid's average summary is exported incorrectly,"<p>Hi DevEx<br />
<br />
I believe I&#39;ve found a bug with the grid export mechanism. I have a grid column bound to a nullable integer, and an average summary displayed in the footer. When I export the grid to PDF, HTML etc. the printed average in the footer gives a different value. It seems that the exported average counts null values as part of its calculation, where as the grid does not. Either way, I shouldn&#39;t be getting different values for the same calculation!<br />
<br />
I have attached a couple of screenshots to illustrate this.<br />
<br />
All the other summary types seem to work as expected.<br />

<p>Here is the same form with Dx16 &hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have decided to give you images rather than code at this stage on the off chance that there may be something that rings a bell.</p>

The underlying record is correct and will save to the db ok. A similar problem occurs if a saved record is retrieved and bound to the form. It is simply a display issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Payable To field on the left-hand side is exactly the same editor and it is working correctly. The only real difference that I can see is that it does not have a default value. BTW the ValueMember is a Guid.</p>

TreeList -  Incorrect column resizing behaviour,"<p>We have an issue with ASP.NET MVC Treelist control. It is incorrectly  shown when in the settings set:<br />

When I set the resize to be &quot;NextColumn&quot;, and this is the only change in the code between screenshots, the column with icons and expand/collapse controls behaves weird. Icons oftenly cropped by the column border, vertical lines are to close to each other...<br />

TreeList - Node cells are empty after restoring a layout created in earlier versions,"<p>We upgraded to 13.2.5. We have multiple forms with treelists on. Our users can save the layouts of the treelists. the saved layout is restored when the form opens. After upgrading to 13.2.5 we realised that this restoring of the layouts gives unexpected results. Most columns with just text in does not show any text etc. <br />
 <br />
The problem can be resolved as follows: The user deletes the layout xml. Close the form and opens it again. The form loads with the native layout. He then changes the layout the way he wants and save it again. When he opens the form the 3rd time, the layout restores as expected.<br />
<br />
The problem that remains is that our project has hundreds of layouts saved. In other words this will take our users  hours or days to redo all the layouts. We will not be very popular. Do you have any suggestions? <br />
<br />
This is critical for us because you solved a number of problems in this release and we want to roll it out as soon as possible.</p>"

Validation - Aggregated property validation can be bypassed when this single property is edited in the embedded DetailView of the ListView with MasterDetailMode = ListViewAndDetailView,"I have a business object with a FileData property for file attachments. &nbsp;I've given this property the RuleRequired attribute so that the user must attach a file when saving that type of business object.<br /><br />However, I've discovered that if the user right-clicks on the property and chooses ""Clear Content"" from the popup menu that appears, they can save the business object without triggering the rule.  &nbsp;(The application knows they've changed something, because the Save button is enabled once ""Clear Content"" is clicked.)<br /><br />This only appears to happen when I'm viewing the object in a ListViewAndDetailView  tab. &nbsp;And the rule is triggered if another property of the object is changed."

Visual Studio Designer freezes on an attempt to edit XAML with BarItems,"Hello Support,<br><br>Hello Support,<br><br>I have been working on ViewX for the past 3+ years, and have been using DevExpress throughout that time. &nbsp;I have upgraded the project as I went along. &nbsp;Obviously I know a lot more today than when I started ViewX. &nbsp;However, my source is my source and it will not be rewritten.&nbsp;My project started using Vs2010 and has migrated to Vs2015 or Vs2017. &nbsp;The update to Vs2015 has been painful as editing of the XAML has become very ugly. Today I finished built a demo project for a memory leak issue. &nbsp;I utilized cut and paste from my ViewX project sources. &nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily, the resulting demo shows some of the major issues that I have been encountering when I try to update the XAML source code. &nbsp;I would appreciate your suggestions and help how to fix my XAML editing. &nbsp;The VS 2017 is a default install. &nbsp;The CodeRush is the default install, but I disabled the XAML features trying to just edit the code. &nbsp;I do look forward to using CodeRush in my future editing. &nbsp;I have included the project zip file in this post and will include a video in the next post.<br><br>Thank you in advance for your help,<br><br>Bryce &nbsp;"

WPF Pivot Grid - Lazy loading in the PreFilter Editor,"<p>I like the PreFilter. And I use the PreFilterString to save/load that filter in my serialization of the grid. That works excellent.<br />
<br />
To create a simple condition in the PreFilter Editor needs some learning curve. But I&#39;ve serious duration issues. EACH time the Prefilter editor is loaded it costs me about 1.5 minute for a table with 130,000 records and a couple of dozins fields. For my own chart wizard I get all unique values of each field and that costs me 2 secs; excluding the fact fields.<br />
<br />
Is it possible a kind of lazy loading within the editor will be used? Like field values will be fetched not before the user wants to select something from the field value list and the possible values will be cached so it won&#39;t be done when the editor is loaded again.<br />

XtraReports: gradient color bar with XRChart,Hi<br><br>Please see attached. I need to make a visual guide in a report as shown and I'm unsure on what control to try and do this in. Should I do it in a chart if it can behave this way?<br><br>Both arrows are positioned  using the same value technique i.e. percentage%. I need to be able to style the arrow as shown along with the the color bar either being solid colors or a gradient through the colors (if that it at all possible)<br><br>Thanks<br><br> 
XtraScheduler - Gantt View - Horizontal Scroll,"We are using Scheduler control, Gantt View. For horizontal scroll, if user tries to scroll by dragging the slider , it always comes to the end of the scroll bar and then jumps back. Our clients were asking if we can change it to ""infinite"" scroll? Please see attached video."

XtraSpreadsheet - Conditional formatting defined for a cell is overridden by NumberFormat,"Run the repro project<br><br>In cell A1 there is a conditional formatting rule that says that values between -2 and 2 should be green.<br><br>That same cell has ""0.000;[Red]-0.000"" as NumberFormat<br><br>If I input -1 in the cell A1, the number format has priority over the conditional formatting and the value is red instead of green. That is a bug.<br><br>Download the workbook and open it in Excel, you will notice that the conditional formatting should have priority.<br>"

XtraVerticalGrid - Read-only rows are not grayed out,"<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
We are currently using DevExpress version V12.2.10 .0. Earlier we were using V8.2.6.0. Then we upgraded to V12.2.10.0.<br />
<br />
<strong>Scenario:<br />
<br />
</strong>1) DevExpress.XtraVerticalGrid.PropertyGridControl is used to display the object attributes and values of those attributes.<br />
2) Read each row and depending on the attributes we decide to allow user to edit the value of attribute or make the row readonly.<br />
3) To make the row readonly, we use following code:<br />
    row.Properties.ReadOnly = true;<br />
<br />
<strong>Observed behavior with DevExpress version V8.2.6.0:</strong><br />
If we set row.Properties.ReadOnly to true,  its cell value become grey. Looks like semi-transparent. <br />
<br />
<strong>Observed behavior with DevExpress version V12.2.10.0:</strong><br />
If we set row.Properties.ReadOnly to true,  its cell value colour does not change. <br />
<br />
<strong>Issue:</strong><br />
We can not differentiate readonly attributes and editable attributes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Questions:</strong><br />
1) Is it expected behavior in V12.2.10.0 or is it regression?<br />
2) What is solution for this issue?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

ZoomTrackBarControl - Provide the capability to snap the scroll thumb to a particular notch while dragging,"<p>I would like to see a SnapToMiddleValue property added to the ZoomTrackBarControl control, in order to make it act like the zoom trackbar in, say, Microsoft Word 2010.<br />
Start up Word 2010. In the lower-right corner of the Word window, you&#39;ll see a zoom trackbar, preset to 100%. Drag the trackbar to the left until it&#39;s somewhere around 50% or so. Then, drag it back towards the center (100%). When it gets near 100%, it&#39;ll &quot;snap&quot; to the 100% mark.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for considering</p>"
